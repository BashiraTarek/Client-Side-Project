# Client Side Project

This project is a client-side web application built to provide users with features related to user registration, authentication, product browsing, and shopping cart functionality. It allows users to register, login, browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and view their cart contents.

## Features

1. **User Registration**: Users can register with their username, email, phone number, birthday date, and password. The registration form performs validation for each input field to ensure data integrity.

2. **User Authentication**: Registered users can login with their credentials to access the application's features. User authentication is implemented using local storage to store user data.

3. **Product Browsing**: The application displays a selection of products retrieved from local storage. Each product includes an image, name, description, and price. Users can view product details and add them to their shopping cart.

4. **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart, view the items in their cart, and proceed to checkout. The shopping cart data is stored in local storage for persistence across sessions.
